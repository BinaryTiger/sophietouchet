I understand that designing the interior is very important whether it’s a home, school, office or any other building as it makes a place look unique and fit for purpose. I wish to help people to live and work in appropriate and attractive spaces. I believe I can achieve that through hard work, great effort and devoting a sufficient amount of time. That is why I have chosen interior design."

During my studies, I dealt with different forms of art and eventually I discovered interior design. After graduating, I decided to concentrate on my modeling career that brought me around the world. This experience initiated in me this eagerness to design through teamwork. Since 2015, I studied an Interior Design Training Program at Herzing College Montreal."
